# Java-FX-Graphing-Calculator

This is my first personal project and its purpose is to improve and demonstrate my ability to create and develop a complex algorithm, that is, an algorithm that reads user input in the form of an expression and evaluates that expression. For this particular project I opted to try and make a graphing calcuator in Java FX using a custom stack-based algorithm that I designed to parse user input and translate that into different graphs on a chart. The app mimics what Desmos is capable of doing but at a lesser scale. Some of the functions of the app are the ability to plot multiple lines, get notified about incorrect input, create a new graph whenever you want, and zooming in and out of different areas within the graph. This is a project that I tried my best to finish within 30 days during winter break between semesters. I wanted to show some proficiency in my progamming abilities and initiative to plan, create, and finish a project I thought would be a good idea in my head while being more or less original.
